/**
You are working on a to-do list app. The tasks are stored in an integer array nums, where each number represents a task ID.

Sometimes, unfinished tasks are marked as 0.
Before showing the list to the user, the app wants to move all the unfinished tasks (0s) to the bottom, while keeping the order of the other tasks the same.

Important: You must do this in-place (without making a new copy of the list).

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,0,2,0,3,0]
Output: [1,2,3,0,0,0]
